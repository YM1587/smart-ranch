✅ BIG PICTURE SUMMARY

Your system tracks FOUR CORE DIMENSIONS:

🐄 Biological (animals, health, breeding)
🌾 Operational (feed, labor, pens)
📈 Production (milk, weight, growth)
💰 Financial (costs, income, profit)

Together, this enables:

True animal-level profit & loss tracking
(Which most real farms do NOT have)
